----

This project is not a vulnerable application. It is a framework designed for quickly configuring training virtual machines with tools and vulnerable application targets. This of this as a base box with a specialized package manager.
For example, an instructor could use SamuraiWTF to easily set up a classroom virtual machine image containing OWASP ZAP and OWASP Juice Shop, and then distribute it to each student.

This project includes and uses the [Samurai Katana][samurai-katana-url] project to manage installation and running of tools and targets in the virtual environment. 

**Want to chat with us? Join us in either the OWASP Slack #project-samuraiwtf channel.**

**Want to Contribute? See [here](#Contributors)**

**NOTE:** for getting started quickly you can follow the ova installation [here](#OVA)

**Art Credit:** the above Samurai figure is the original work of Ben Faircloth, who has granted the OWASP SamuraiWTF project permission to use in the product and websites. 

## Initial Install
There are several options for the initial install, as follows:

### Vagrant (Preferred)
Starting with version 5.0 of SamuraiWTF we now use an Ubuntu-based basebox that has most of the prerequisites pre-installed so you can get up and running quickly.

1. Make sure you have Oracle VirtualBox installed (see above [OVA section](#OVA))
2. Clone this repository.
3. From a command-line terminal in the root project folder, run the command `vagrant up`. Then sit back and wait for it to finish.

**note**: The login is samurai/samurai

### OVA on Oracle VirtualBox
1. Make sure you have the Oracle VirtualBox installed, and if you are in Windows you should disable Hyper-V [(Instructions from Microsoft)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3204980/virtualization-applications-do-not-work-together-with-hyper-v-device-g).
2. Download the OVA to import a full virtual machine, here: https://tiny.si/samurai

**note**: The login is samurai/samurai

### AWS Workspace
We have a method of bootstrapping SamuraiWTF into an AWS Workspace (running AWS Linux). This can be useful in situations an instructor wants to set up a remotely accessible SamuraiWTF environment.

1. Make sure you have an AWS account plus the AWS Workspaces client.
2. Create a Workspace with Amazon Linux and 4GB of RAM
3. Log in to the workspace and clone this GitHub repository.
4. Navigate into `samuraiwtf/base/amazon-linux` and run the `bootstrap.sh` shell script. This should set up the rest of what you need.

**note**: The login is your AWS Workspace username and password.

## Lab Quick Setup
Once you log in to the environment, you can install tools and targets using katana either from the command line, or from a browser.

### Command Line
Simply use the command `katana list` to see which packages are available, then install any package with `katana install <package>`. For example, to install ZAP and JuiceShop:

```shell script
katana install zap
katana install juice-shop
katana start juice-shop
```

## Web UI
The web UI can be seen in a browser by visiting `http://katana.wtf`.

If it is not running, you may first need to use the command line to install and start katana. This is done with the commands:
```shell script
katana install katana
katana start katana
```

More detailed instructions on using Katana are available in the readme of the [Samurai Katana][samurai-katana-url] GitHub project.

**IMPORTANT**: Be aware that Katana runs with root privileges and is not intended to be run in a secure or production environment.

## Development
Most of the development in this repo is related to updating basebox provisioning scripts and supporting additional platforms.


- Our integration branch is the one called `next`. That's where all new features and bug fixes go for testing before a planned release.  The `main` branch should be kept stable at all times.
- Larger changes should be done in separate feature branches.  Make sure to merge `next` into your feature branch, then PR the feature branch to merge into `next`.
- If you break `next` or `main`, fix it (with help if necessary). It's best to run a full test build (i.e. `vagrant destroy`, `vagrant up`) and make sure tools ard targets are working before pushing changes.

## Production VM Notes:
Once you load the VM, unless this was a AWS Workspace install the username and password are:

- Username: samurai
- Password: samurai

The menus are available in the top-left corner of the desktop.

Once you log in, there are a couple of things that might need to be adjusted manually.

## Virtualbox Display
- To automatically adjust the display resolution, do the following:
	- Select Virtualbox `Menu -> View`
	- Click Auto-Resize Guest Display
	- Resize Virtualbox window and display should change to fit window size.
	- OR: Use the `Menu -> View -> Virtual Screen 1` menu to adjust the screen dimensions (e.g. Resize to 1440x900; Scale to 200%).
